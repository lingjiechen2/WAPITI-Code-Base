                "Proclus of Athens (*412\u2013485 C.E.) was the most authoritative philosopher of late antiquity and played a crucial role in the transmission of Platonic philosophy from antiquity to the Middle Ages. For almost fifty years, he was head or more often dean and/or general professor of the distinguished Athens school where he taught and wrote heretical, leading up to heresy trials against both himself and the school in 414. His metaphysics contains elements that coherently expand upon the Platonic ontology as sketched by his predecessors - especially Aristotle - and suggest that he may have been influenced by Kant's metaphysics ascribed to Moses Maimonides. His work has remained immune to subsequent critical scrutiny and only lately have contemporary subjects been examined systematically as part of a reconstruction of his ideas. In the course of seeking out valid criteria for evaluating ancient arguments and postulating Proclus' doctrines as \"common knowledge,\" no scholarly work has unravelled Proclus' metaphysics to the same degree as Proclus' own arguments and all of the other metaphysicists who have been examined - Proclus himself said all thinkers who have brought out anything new are heretics - have been rejected as heretics by Proclus himself.

Weeden established himself as a workable zone-read specialist who can calm down the Browns' all-in gun who doesn't want to make last-second defensive stand sells because he doesn't want to waste your breath.\nTwo weeks in, Weeden's Woodley machine has whopped three Franks to open 2-yard Andersen-rated passing drills: Blake",

Maybe not about the fish and chips, but about whether we are free to do things that other people define as free.\nRecently, Philip Pettit of the Athens Institute for Education and Research has concluded that free will is not possible. Pettit contrasts free will to determinism, in which everything is predestined as impossible to be decided other than by some experimental animal; to escape from such things, he proposes to withhold features of free potentiality (if all is foreordained), or to give up the concept of free choice to avoid confusion.\nHis conclusion that it is only possible to be entirely determined, and to lack free choice, has prompted a number of legal scholars to challenge Pettit's position as unjustified in philosophical arguments.\nI'd like to add to Pettits discussion in only two minor ways: first, he does not recognise limitations to free acts as being part of the concept of free will or choice; but previous discussion has used the same philosophical category as framework to establish free will disputes as being about free acts. Second, Pettis choice is",

As Verstappen drove wide into Turn One but remained out of position wide because of Bottas\u2019 mistake, Vettel shunted some distance wide to force him to follow him down the inside of Turn One.\nVettel\u2019s first lap was about fast acceleration and compacting the package to be competitive with Ferrari, as Verstappen has historically been unable to attain.

These outsourcing customers are also canceling job offers to require more of firms' local resource in projects. They have sought greater control over IT projects to cut costs and reduce risks.\nHowever, because IT teams needing to monitor changes to create business scenarios involving multi-functional teams (i.e., involving more than one business function) have to integrate large quantities of often incoherent shared model scenarios, they may want more fact-based analyses -- hence greater in-depth knowledge of costs. As a result, IT project teams may want to control who may have access to what model scenarios as well as to who may have greater access to cost estimating information to be used to plan IT projects.\nCompanies have used project teams to categorize situations as extraordinary, longer, more difficult projects only to raise additional costs to sustain status-quo inefficiencies.

You can find advertisements for privately-owned rentals in the classified section of your newspaper, on the internet at sites like Craig's List and Rental.com, as well as through local real estate agents.\nMany local homeowners and condo owners rent their houses because they are having trouble selling them in the current real estate market, so you may be able to find a very nice property at a reasonable rate, provided you are a good tenant and are willing to keep the place clean and in order.\nHowever, more and more private owners are looking at credit checks as one way to separate the \"good\" tenants from the \"bad\" tenants.

                "Record low and negative interest rates in developed economies are fueling a ravenous search for yield that is forcing pension funds and other conservative institutional investors out of their comfort zones and into risky emerging markets, according to fund managers and analysts.\nThe reason for this has little to do with the attractiveness of EM investments. On the contrary, EM economic growth is at its lowest level since the 2008/09 financial crisis while the prospect of a U.S. monetary tightening creates the potential for financial turbulence.\nThe force propelling pension funds and insurance companies into unfamiliar EM investments is simple. If they stay at home, their investment returns are at risk of falling short of their liabilities.\n\"If you require, say, 5 percent a year in order to cover your insurance or pension liabilities, that is not available from developed market (debt) obviously,\" said Colm McDonagh, head of emerging market fixed income at Insight Investment.\nBrett Diment, head of emerging market debt at Aberdeen Asset Management, also sees a diversification into EM debt by pension and insurance companies. \"We are seeing a broader group of investors looking at the emerging market debt asset class, including some insurers and pension funds that have not looked before.\"\nMuch of this search for yield",

I think the integrity is a big piece to it,\" O&apos;Donnell said.\nNevada&apos;s effective monopoly on sports betting ended last spring, when the Supreme Court ruled the ban should be lifted.

The list is expected to grow by next year with numerous states considering bills.\nAnd there&apos;s already a hitch that could slow bets: NASCAR this season has decided for the first time to strip drivers of victories if their cars are deemed illegal. There will be a roughly 90-minute inspection after the race and the winner will not be deemed official until the process is completed. Will fans really want to linger around the pay window another couple of hours just to cash in a ticket?\n\"The state&apos;s risk manager will delay any payout until NASCAR releases the official order of finish,\" Kirk said.",

Sharpening his focus on the economy, he offered a hodgepodge of tax breaks and other incentives to create new jobs.\nFor Republicans, Obama blended a mix of overtures and digs. But he mainly addressed fellow Democrats, who still can enact his agenda if they overcome fears fueled by events such as last week's stunning GOP victory in the Massachusetts Senate race.\nThat setback may have cost Democrats their filibuster-proof Senate majority, Obama said, but \"we still have the largest majority in decades, and the people expect us to solve some problems, not run for the hills.\"\nHe accepted partial blame for the deep troubles facing his health care push, but he implored lawmakers to finish the task rather than yield to public opposition.\n\"The longer it was debated, the more skeptical people became,\" Obama told the joint session of Congress and a nationwide TV audience.

At the end of Wonder Woman, Chris Pine's Steve Trevor heroically sacrifices himself to save everyone else. It marked the death of some great on-screen chemistry between Pine and Gal Gadot.\nBut today, director Patty Jenkins has revealed the first details about the upcoming sequel, Wonder Woman 1984. It takes place in, well, 1984, and somehow marks the return of Pine's Steve Trevor. Jenkins tweeted a photo of Pine on set for the film, and he's got a great fit with a Member's Only jacket and a vintage Casio watch. He also looks pretty damn good for being either dead or at least 90 years old.

The company reported a 12% drop in revenue from its Barbie brand, while other girls' toys ate up market share. The American Girl and Monster High lines did particularly well, but the cost was high. As the newer lines continue to succeed, the questions around Barbie's future grow.\nMonster High is leading the way at Mattel, and analysts now believe that the business may be worth up to $500 million annually. That success has helped steer Mattel toward new opportunities, including a variation on Monster High -- which is a line of monsters in high school -- called Ever After High. The new line is going to hit stores in the second half of the year, and focuses on classic fairytale characters while they're in high school.\nWhen I say \"classic fairytale characters,\" I, of course, mean slightly rebranded Disney (NYSE:DIS) princesses.

In the photo, hundreds of unprocessed medical records sit idly, causing delays of up to five months.\nAccording to a whistle-blower who wished to remain anonymous because they are still employed by the Memphis VA Medical Center, the medical records room is for entering test results and other medical data that occurs after a patient is outsourced for medical tests or procedures.\nA recent audit by the VA flagged the Memphis VA Medical Center after it found the facility had an average wait time for the initial appointment of fifty days.\nThe medical records shown in the photo are generated when the VA refers a patient to another hospital for further medical procedures. Medical tests like colonoscopies, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and X-rays, are among the tests that can be performed by an outside hospital, said the whistle-blower.\nThe outside hospital then sends their results back to the Memphis VA Medical Center, and those results are supposed to be scanned into the VA system.\nInstead of being scanned",

For almost fifty years, he was head or \u2018successor\u2019 (diadochos, sc. of Plato) of the Platonic \u2018Academy\u2019 in Athens. Being an exceptionally productive writer, he composed commentaries on Aristotle, Euclid and Plato, systematic treatises in all disciplines of philosophy as it was at that time (metaphysics and theology, physics, astronomy, mathematics, ethics) and exegetical works on traditions of religious wisdom (Orphism and Chaldaean Oracles). Proclus had a lasting influence on the development of the late Neoplatonic schools not only in Athens, but also in Alexandria, where his student Ammonius became the head of the school. In a culture dominated by Christianity, the Neoplatonic philosophers had to defend the superiority of the Hellenic traditions of wisdom. Continuing a movement that was inaugurated by Iamblichus (4th c.) and the charismatic figure of emperor Julian, and following the teaching of Syrianus, Proclus was eager to",

Pierced cheeks, eyebrows, tongues, navels, and unmentionables are popping up on teenagers across the nation, and the trend shows no signs of ebbing anytime soon.\nParents have complained to lawmakers that they have no say in their fashion-conscious teenagers' decisions to get pierced. Others worry about health risks of piercing--most commonly, treatable skin infections, but also the remote possibility of contracting infectious diseases such as hepatitis or AIDS from unsterilized piercing instruments.\nSpurred by these concerns, state legislatures are reining in the trend. More than half of the nation's states have provisions on the books regulating the body-piercing industry, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Florida, Georgia, Michigan, and Oregon, for example, require parental consent for minors seeking to get pierced. Several other states are debating the issue.\n\"This year was the year for body piercing and tattooing,\" said Lisa Speissegger, who covers health policy for the NCSL.

This in no small part stemmed from the reliability of the connection: the device would connect to 3G less than a quarter of the time to 3G even in areas AT&T says should provide \"excellent\" coverage, according to the lawsuit.\nI've previously mentioned my problems with the lack of AT&T 3G coverage in my area when their online coverage viewer says it should be \"excellent.\" However, Since AT&T installed a new tower in my area earlier this month, 3G and GSM reception has been appreciably better. For example, I can now receive phone calls in my house. Obviously, your mileage will vary.\nBut why Apple? Shouldn't the suit be directed to AT&T who is providing such poor 3G coverage and support even where \"coverage\" exists?",
                "Your credit card company doesn't have your best interests at heart.\nCredit cards have caused financial pain for millions of consumers. It's easy to run up a balance, but as too many people find out the hard way, it's a lot harder to get it paid down. Even if you're diligent about getting your debt repaid, high interest rates work against you, creating a big headwind that's hard to fight against month after month.\nEven your credit card issuer's own policies can tempt you into staying in debt a lot longer than you should. By simply ignoring your card company's advice and doing what most people would logically think of as the right way to pay down debt, you can get your card balances zeroed out years sooner. Below, we'll show you how to do it and why so many people don't.\nThe problem that so many credit card holders run into has to do with the minimum payment provisions that card companies have. You'd think that a lender would want to get repaid as soon as possible, but that's actually not the case for credit card companies. The opportunity to charge double-digit interest rates in an environment where mortgage loans generate less than 5% interest for lenders encourages lenders to keep those card balances",

Morgenthau of Manhattan, who announced the indictments, said they resulted from a study of the three hotels announced last December by the city. He said his office was delayed in moving more quickly on the case because of difficulty in finding the welfare recipients involved in the purported scam.\nAlthough the investigation found that each of the hotels was receiving about twice as many welfare checks as it had occupied rooms, Mr. Morgenthau said the difficulty in tracking down homeless people believed to be involved in the purported scam resulted only in charges involving the Barbour. None of the 10 welfare recipients who were located in the search were charged because they are aiding the prosecution by giving testimony, officials said.\nCity welfare regulations require a person to provide a rent receipt to qualify for welfare, but officials at the city's Human Resources Administration said welfare recipients have never been formally referred by the agency to any of the three hotels.\nIndicted yesterday were the vice president of the operating company, Zisla Nikelsberg, 49 years old, of Brooklyn, and the secretary",

                "Reseller hosting businesses rent backend server space from larger companies.\n2 Can You Make Money Being a Web-hosting Reseller?\nWeb hosting companies earn money by selling server space to individuals and businesses. While some hosting companies own their own servers, many new hosting ventures begin by renting server space from another provider. This is known as \"reseller hosting.\" Typically, the larger company provides \"backend\" service that is not visible to the end user, and a reseller hosting business re-brands and sells the available server space.\nCreate a general business plan for the hosting business. Decide which market niche the hosting services will fill. For instance, some hosting companies compete by offering basic hosting at very low prices, while others offer website building services or specialized software support. Establish a list of services and prices that will be offered by the company. If many different services will be offered, split them into several different packages and pricing levels.\nDetermine what technical support options the company will offer. Around the clock customer support via phone can be attractive to customers, but requires more staff members than basic e-mail technical support.

The analysis for the Department of Education found that, on average, students doing some or all of the course online would rank in the 59th percentile in tested performance, compared with the average classroom student scoring in the 50th percentile.

                "In your lifetime, you've wished upon many stars.\nYou've spotted a twinkle in the night sky and hoped for love or fulfillment of a dream. You've wished for good grades, better money, the return of a loved one. And sometimes, you've wished for the impossible.\nBut was the wish fulfilled, or was the star just another ball of gas? For a woman in the 1850s, it was the latter: In \"The Rebellion of Miss Lucy Ann Lobdell\" by William Klaber, Lucy futilely wished she was a man.\nOn the morning when she cut her hair, donned her brother's clothes, and slipped from her parents' house before daybreak, Lucy Slater left more than a wretched life behind.\nShe also left her daughter, Helen, which tore her heart. Still, the decision to flee wasn't difficult.\nThree years prior, Lucy's husband abandoned his family, leaving them with nothing and forcing them to live with Lucy's parents. Since she'd married against parental approval, there was only hostility in their home - a situation made worse because they knew that Lucy was most comfortable in the woods, wearing her little brother's clothes. That was unseemly for a",
                "A move to Fridays is rarely a good sign for a TV show, which was the case for Raising Hope last fall. So while it's certainly disappointing news that the series has been cancelled by Fox, it's not entirely surprising, all things considered. Still, we're going to miss the Chance family!\nDeadline reported the news, stating that the current fourth season of Raising Hope will be its last, and the series will wrap-up with an hour-long farewell on Friday, April 4.\nThe premise of Greg Garcia's series centers on a twenty-something guy whose one-night-stand with a serial killer results in the birth of a daughter named Hope, whom Jimmy ends up raising. But the bigger picture is the series' emphasis on the Chances, a blue-collar family living a simple life and doing what they can to raise Hope right. In addition to Lucas Neff, who plays Jimmy, the cast includes Martha Plimpton, Garret Dillahunt, Shannon Woodward and Cloris Leachman. Of all the characters, i was always a fan of Plimpton and Dillahunt's Virginia and Burt, as their history and the evident love they have for one another often yielded some of the fun",

Flagler is one of 18 counties in the St. Johns district.\nThe tentative 0.3283 millage rate (or 32.8 cents per $1,000 in taxable value) is about a 1 percent decrease from the current year\u2019s millage rate and would result in $80.6 million in property tax revenue for the district. The total $135.5 million proposed budget is slated to be funded with the property tax revenue, plus state, federal and other sources (including timber sales, cattle leases, interest earnings, permit fees and fund balances).\nFor Flagler County residents, the tax rate means that a property owner with a $150,000 house and a $50,000 homestead exemption will have a $33 bill from the district. The tax bill is included as a line-item among all other municipal, school and county taxes. The owner of a $200,000 house with a $",

                "How do I know when I should exit a trade?\nAre there some rules on this that I can follow?\nMany traders approach their strategy with one thing in mind: establishing the qualifications for entry. The \u2018edge\u2019 if you will. From there, the trade should take care of itself, right? Not really. How you manage a trade after it has been taken is perhaps the most important dynamic to a true strategy (as opposed to approaching the market trade by trade). Once in a trade, you have cast your line; and the result will ultimately be a gain or a loss. Yet, unless you think this one trade will make you wealthy enough to retire after its closed; it is important to establish some consistent (if flexible) parameters for when you should exit the market with a profit or (preferably) a tolerable loss. What are the considerations you should account for when looking for the exit?\nThe first rule for plotting your exit is to have some notion of how you will get out of your trade before you even put it on. For those traders that are utter beginners, we usually hammer home the concept of defining a hard stop and target before you even enter a position. This is just a suggestion to instill good habits \u2013",

The technology can be used to produce nuclear fuel, but also materials for atomic bombs.\nThe U.S. and other countries accuse Iran of developing weapons, but Tehran says it only seeks reactors for energy and research, and refuses to halt its uranium enrichment activities.\n\"Kayhan received reports yesterday that show Iran has begun uranium enrichment at the Fordo facility amid heightened foreign enemy threats,\" the paper said in a front-page report.
